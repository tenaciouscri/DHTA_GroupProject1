### Article Daniel

I would like to welcome you to my very first article written within the 
terminal using the markdown syntax. So far I have learned a tonne. It 
may not seem like so much in the future but right now it's all new so it 
requires my full attention. I've been learning how to use the terminal 
and how to write markdown files and over the last few lectures we've 
began our venture into the world of Git.

I love pancakes! I'm also really enjoying learning these new skills so 
far and Johannes is a great teacher :D

### Article Cristina

Learning how to code is something that I've always wanted to do, but 
never fully delved into. I'm so happy that I'm finally doing it! We're 
only one week in but I've already learned so much; from the basic 
commands in the terminal to markdowns, and right now we're exploring the 
world of git! I've never done anything like this so it's really exciting 
to do something new and learn new skills. I'm so grateful for this 
opportunity and I can't wait to tackle Python, as I'm looking forward to 
seeing what we can do with it.

I love videogames, and my dream would be coding one some day! :)

### Personal Profile Raphaela

Name: Raphaela Vergud
Age: 23 years
Nationality: Austrian

### Article Raphaela

So far I've learned how to navigate the command line in the terminal (more or less) and pushing and pulling from GitHub!
It's all super fascinating and I never thought I'd be able to be comfortable looking at the terminal but now I am.
I'm also grateful Johannes is so patient whenever I want to ask him questions.

I love running and eating sweets and pastries! The sweeter, the better.
