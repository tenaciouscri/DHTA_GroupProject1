### Personal Profile 1 Daniel

Name: Daniel Lambert 
Age: 26 years
Nationality: Irish


### Article Daniel

I would like to welcome you to my very first article written within the terminal using the markdown syntax.
So far I have learned a tonne. It may not seem like so much in the future but right now it's all new so it requires my full attention.
I've been learning how to use the terminal and how to write markdown files and over the last few lectures we've began our venture into the world of Git.

I love pancakes! I'm also really enjoying learning these new skills so far and Johannes is a great teacher :D

### Personal Profile Raphaela

Name: Raphaela Vergud
Age: 23 years
Nationality: Austrian

### Article Raphaela

So far I've learned how to navigate the command line in the terminal (more or less) and pushing and pulling from GitHub!
It's all super fascinating and I never thought I'd be able to be comfortable looking at the terminal but now I am.
I'm also grateful Johannes is so patient whenever I want to ask him questions.

### More...

I love running and eating sweets and pastries! The sweeter, the better.
